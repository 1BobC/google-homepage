Project HTML/CSS in TOP Web Development 101

Purpose: 
To start thinking about how elements get placed on the page and roughly how they get 
styled and aligned.

Activity:
Deconstruct an existing web page, the Google home page 
and rebuild it in a very basic form (even if it doesn’t “go” anywhere)  

Check Skills:
Two ways to move a div around on the page
Stick a div onto the bottom or top of the page
Identify the background color of an existing webpage
Grab the URL for an image from an existing webpage
Center an element horizontally
Identify three ways you can include your CSS styles in a page
Understand how to use classes and ids to target CSS at specific elements on the page
    
Steps in Project:
Create folder the-odin-project and sub-folder google-homepage.
Create files index.html and README.md
Create new repo on GitHub google-homepage.
Clone to Terminal. 
Push both files to github.

Process:
Open index.html in the the-odin-project folder in VSCode and open with Live Server.
Create topnav navigation bar for About, Store, Gmail, Images, Apps, Sign in at top of page.
Position Google logo, position text form in middle of page.
Create navbar navigation bar for Advertising, Business, How Search Works, Privacy Terms, Settings at bottom of page.
Check code appearance on web page.
Check code on Google homepage with Inspect Element facility.
Write project description and conclusion in file README.md.
Save and push both files to GitHub.

Conclusion:
I have produced a very basic copy of the Google homepage to show four parts, the top navigation bar, the central Google logo, the text box for search queries and the bottom navigation bar.
When trying code to add and enhance the appearance of elements to a more accurate copy I found that I was either not achieving any changes or upsetting the appearance of the existing elements.
I was losing track of exactly which CSS code affected which elements.
When I realised this I felt the time had come to stop.
To correct this I think I need, obviously, to study examples and learn more HTML and CSS code but also learn more of how I can structure my code to ensure that I can more efficiently check that the CSS code controls the relevant elements.
A very useful first project.
